"""
This script is a basic Scrapy spider designed to manage social media content.
It can be extended to include specific functionality like posting,
liking, commenting, or following based on the social media platform's API or web structure.

To use this script, you need to:
1. Define the allowed_domains and start_urls for the social media platforms you want to interact with.
2. Implement the parse method to extract relevant data or perform actions on the social media platform.
3. Add error handling to ensure the spider can recover from potential errors during the crawling process.
4. Configure the project settings (settings.py) to define the project's behavior, such as user agents, proxies, and more.
